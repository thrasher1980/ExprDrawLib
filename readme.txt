In this project I tryied make a wrapper of library ExprDraw of Anton Grigoriev. 
This library was written by Delphi at 2002(!) and I was must make some changes into original code to one work correctly in present-day OS. I used Delphi XE5 for it.

WARNING. Project ExprDrawGuide contains original code from Anton Grigoriev. 
It may be compiles in Delphi 7 and Delphi XE5.  This project is example how use. 
Oh yeah, It is on Russian but i think it not difficulty and btw all of examples of math expressions are some intuitive. Try it!

The syntax of math expression in ExprDraw is similar to the syntax of math expression is CSharp and it is much easier than the MimeTeX expressions syntaxis.

The project ExprDrawLib contains modified code which i use for my library. Please use it!

I tried that library could work in x64 but I suffered fiasco in that . It work only in Console Appliocation. 

But in x86 library work correctly always.

WARNING. Make sure that ExprDrawLib32.dll or ExprDrawLib64.dll will be in your Application executable module folder.
